[Description]
Linen Mist is a text adventure based on Zork's I
mechanics developed as an exercise for UPC's master
degree on gaming developement.

You wake up in a linen-colored mist. You don't
remember anything about you, or how did you got
here, but it feels like you're being hunted by
something or someone...

With the unsettling feeling of being chased, you
only option is go and figure out the truth by
yourself.
